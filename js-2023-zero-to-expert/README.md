## JS fundamentals - Part 1

### Hello world

Try code in the browser developer tool

```js
alert("Hello World!")

let js = 'amazing'
if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')

js = 'boring'
if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')
```

### Brief introduction to JS

> JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

- A programming language is basically just a tool that allows us
  to write code that will instruct a computer to do something
- High-level: we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management,... It make the language a lot easier to write and to learn
- OOP: the language is mostly based on the concept of objects for storing most kinds of data
- Multi-paradigm language: we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming

The role of JavaScript in web development:

- 3 core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, JS
  - HTML: content
  - CSS: presentation
  - JS: building web applications

There is nothing you can't do with JS (almost)

- Dynamic effects and web application in the browser (front-end apps)
- FE web framework: React, Angular, Vue
- Web applications on web servers (back-end apps)
- Native mobile applications: React native, ionic
- Native desktop applicatioins: electron

JavaScript releases

- ES5
- ES6/ES2015 (biggest update to the language ever)
